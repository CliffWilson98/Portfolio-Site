    <h1> Different types of operating systems</h1>

    <p> 
        As part of my operating systems course I have learned about the different types
        of operating systems that exist. Below I will list a few of them along with a 
        brief description. All information found on this page comes from the 4th edition of Modern Operating
        Systems by Andrew Tanenbaum and Herbet Bos.

    <h2> Mainframe </h2>

    <p> Operating systems designed for mainframes are the most powerful of any. These computers
        are often large enough to fill entire rooms and often have the ability to store 
        millions of gigabytes of data.
    </p>

    <h2> Server </h2>
    <p>Server operating systems are one level down from Mainframes. Servers can serve many users at once 
        and allow for the sharing of resources. 
    </p>

    <h2> Multiprocessor </h2>
    <p>Multiprocessor operating systems are designed to take advantage of 
        systems which connect many CPUs in order to increase performance. It is a challenge to allow 
        applications to make use of processing power that is spread across multiple CPUs.
    </p>

    <h2> Personal </h2>

    <p>Personal computer operating systems are the operating systems that most people are familiar with. 
        Common examples are Windows 10, Apple's OS X, and Linux.
