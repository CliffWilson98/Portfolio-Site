                The Phaser Asteroid Dodger game is a very simple client side application in which the player must try to dodge asteroids for as long as possible. The player is controlled using WASD. 
                The longer the player goes without getting hit, the higher their score will be. The game will also become more difficult over time with more asteroids spawning in based on the players current score. 
                The players highest score is saved using the local storage api and is displayed upon completion of the game.

                As the title would suggest, this game was created using the Phaser framework. Phaser is a very popular JavaScript framework for building 2D games. Although it seems to be loved by many, I found there to be 
                a surprising lack of good official documentation, at least for Phaser 3 (The latest version). A majority of the documentation is done through code examples on the website, but I was often unable to easily find
                examples for what I was trying to do. My preferred way of learning any library/framework is by looking at the API docs. An example of a JavaScript library that I believe has excellent API docs is Babylon JS, which is 
                built for 3D graphics on the web. Despite the fact that 3D programming is almost always considered to be harder than 2D, I found it easier to do things in Babylon simply because the API documentation is so much better than
                that for Phaser.
