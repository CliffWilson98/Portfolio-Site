            <h1> Godot as an Alternative to Unity and Unreal</h1>
        </div>

            <p> Although I have never considered myself serious about developing a game of my own, I still enjoy keeping up with 
                the tools that are available for modern game development and experimenting with them myself. For many years, Unity and Unreal have been 
                the two primary engines that are most commonly used by game developers who do not wish to build their own from scratch, 
                but as of lately the Godot engine has been rising in popularity.
            </p>
            <p> One of the most impressive things about Godot is just how lightweight the engine is. The engine is entirely self contained, requiring
                no installer, and is only 60 mb. Last I checked, the Unity engine was well over 500 mb, and Unreal is upwards of 10 gb. Admittedly, Godot is 
                not as feature rich as Unreal or Unity, but I find many of the added "features" of those engines to be extraneous. Godot also boots in seconds,
                even on a slow hard drive. Unreal on the other hand is practically unusable unless you have an SSD. Perhaps the best thing about Godot
                is the fact that the engine is completely free to use and open source. Unity is closed source and parts of Unreal are open source, but both of those engines 
                will charge you if you make a certain amount of money with them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The workflow of Godot is great, and in my opnion it is the easiest engine to rapidly prototype in. Godot allows you to choose between
                two primary means of programming game logic, using either C# or GodotScript. I prefer using GodotScript due to its python like syntax.
                It is in this category that I believe Godot excels. I personally hate the current workflow of Unreal. In Unreal you are forced add game 
                logic through the engines visual scripting solution known as blueprints, or by using C++. Neither choice is great. I am not a fan of visual 
                scripting and I often find it to be a cumbersome and visually cluttered approach. C++ is a better approach in my opinion, but the power of the language
                is an overkill for most things and often requires many lines of code to do otherwise simple tasks.
